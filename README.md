## Introduction
Simon Game is a classic electronic memory game that tests and enhances your memory and reflexes. The game has four colorful buttons, and it plays a sequence of colors in a random order. The player needs to remember and replicate the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order. With each successful round, the sequence becomes longer, making the game progressively challenging.

This project is an implementation of the Simon Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a fun and interactive way to enjoy the nostalgia of the classic game.
